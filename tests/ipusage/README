Proof-of-concept IP usage tracker

Takes IP usage frames and aggregates them in a way that might be more
useful to an end user than hundreds of millions of individual datapoints

inputs are frames with dummy sources of the formats:

	ip_capture:traffic:10.0.0.10:tx_bytes
	ip_capture:traffic:10.0.0.10:rx_bytes
